Key:
Y = Yes 
N = No 
DD = Daily Driver
C = Current DD
M = Maybe 
* = VM (V looks too much like Y in the table - to tired eyes)

NOTE: Daily driver? is an answer to "Would I use this as my daily driver". 
TO Do: Purchase front loading SSD tray and additional SSDs to try liked distros on bare Metal.

Desktops to try: 
Deepin (Arco), Pantheon (Arco) and Unity (Ubuntu)
